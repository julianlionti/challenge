## ðŸš€ About Me

Hi! My name is JuliÃ¡n Lionti, i'm a FullStack Developer since 2011. I've worked in different technologies, including C #, PHP, Java, Swift but since 2018 I've dedicated myself to the Javascript world. Today I focus on NodeJs and React

As for database. The first years, along with C#, I worked with SQL for about 5 years. As I was migrating to NodeJs I also changed the database and decided to use MongoDB. So I am currently working on NoSql databases

I have experience making applications for both Android and iOS. At first I used Java (android) and Swift (iOS) and now I use React Native.
